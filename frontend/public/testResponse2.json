They validate and verify transactions, bundle them into blocks, and then compete with each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the new block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin) for their work. This process is known as mining and it helps to secure and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. Well done!"
